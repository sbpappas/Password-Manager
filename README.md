README

This is a simple encrypted Java password manager.
It stores data between sessions for seamless use and uses a simple GUI with Java libraries for a user experience that extends beyond a simple CLI tool.

Potential future expansions:
Currently it is file-based, but hope to expand to store passwords in a database.
In development: A GUI for a friendlier user experience, still uses same back end code.
